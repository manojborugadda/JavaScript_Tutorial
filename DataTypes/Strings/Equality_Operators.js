//EQUALITY " == " and STRICT EQUALITY " === "

// “==” operator compares only the values of two strings for equality, but it does not compare their types.

// On the other hand, the “===” operator compares the values of two strings and their data types

console.log( “10” == 10 ) //true

console.log("10" === 10); // false
